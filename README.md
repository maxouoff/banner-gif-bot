A script that allows you to change the bot's banner to a gif

To get started, do `npm i` in the console to install all the modules.
Then put your gif in the root of the files.
After that, go to `config.js`, then change the `toke`n and the `file`, in token you put the token of your bot, and in file the name of your file `without the extension` at the end!
To finish do `node .` in the console to start the script.
If you have a problem with `node-fetch`, just do `npm i node-fetch@cjs` in the console, this should fix the problem.
